# Programming Exercises

Welcome to my JavaScript Programming Exercises repository! In this repository, you will find my solutions to various programming exercises that I have completed as part of my JavaScript learning journey.

## Contents

This repository contains one folder with all the JavaScript files for each exercise.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own JavaScript programming exercises. To run the code, you will need to have a JavaScript engine installed on your machine.

Each file all the JavaScript functions for each exercise. The functions are clearly labeled with comments indicating the problem they solve. 

You can test each function by calling it with the necessary arguments in your own JavaScript code.
